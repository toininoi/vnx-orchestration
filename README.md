# VNX

Portable orchestration toolkit for multi-agent terminal workflows.
Coordinates AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) across parallel tmux panes with an append-only receipt ledger, dispatch queue, and quality gates.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **tmux** | Yes | Orchestration runs inside a tmux session (2x2 grid) |
| **bash** | Yes | All scripts are bash/python |
| **python3** | Yes | Receipt processing, state management, intelligence |
| **git** | Yes | Provenance tracking per receipt |
| **iTerm2** | Recommended | Best tmux experience on macOS (native pane titles, mouse support) |
| **jq** | Recommended | Used for hook injection and state queries |
| **fswatch** | Recommended | File watcher for receipt processor (falls back to polling) |
| At least one AI CLI | Yes | `claude` (Claude Code), `codex`, or `gemini` |

Install on macOS:

```bash
brew install tmux jq fswatch
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Vinix24/vnx-orchestration-system.git
cd vnx-orchestration-system

# 2. Install into your project
./install.sh /path/to/your/project

# 3. Initialize, validate, and launch
cd /path/to/your/project
.vnx/bin/vnx bootstrap-skills     # Copy skills to .claude/, .agents/, .gemini/
.vnx/bin/vnx bootstrap-terminals  # Create terminal CLAUDE.md files
.vnx/bin/vnx doctor               # Validate toolchain and layout
.vnx/bin/vnx start                # Launch tmux session (interactive profile selection)
```

`vnx start` creates a tmux session with a 2x2 grid:

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  T0 (orchestrator)│  T1 (Track A)    │
│  Claude Opus     │  Claude / Codex  │
│                  │  / Gemini CLI    │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│  T2 (Track B)    │  T3 (Track C)    │
│  Claude / Codex  │  Claude Opus     │
│  / Gemini CLI    │  deep specialist │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

### Multi-provider profiles

Choose your provider combination at startup:

```bash
.vnx/bin/vnx start                          # Interactive menu
.vnx/bin/vnx start --profile claude-only    # All Claude Code
.vnx/bin/vnx start --profile claude-codex   # T1: Codex CLI
.vnx/bin/vnx start --profile claude-gemini  # T1: Gemini CLI
.vnx/bin/vnx start --profile full-multi     # T1: Codex, T2: Gemini
```

T0 (orchestrator) and T3 (deep specialist) always run Claude Opus.

## Demo (no LLM required)

The smoke test validates the full dispatch-receipt pipeline without any API calls:

```bash
.vnx/bin/vnx smoke
```

This creates an isolated temp workspace, writes a test report, runs the receipt processor in one-shot mode, and verifies a receipt was appended to the ledger. Pass `--keep` to inspect artifacts after the run.

## How It Works

1. **T0 dispatches** a task to a worker terminal via the dispatch queue
2. **Worker executes** the task using its AI CLI (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
3. **Worker writes a report** to `unified_reports/` when done
4. **Receipt processor** detects the report and appends a structured receipt to the NDJSON ledger
5. **T0 gets notified** and can inspect the receipt for status, cost, duration, and git provenance

All state lives on the filesystem. No database, no cloud dependency, no lock-in.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `vnx init` | Create runtime directories and config |
| `vnx doctor` | Validate toolchain, layout, and path hygiene |
| `vnx smoke` | One-shot receipt pipeline test (offline, no LLM) |
| `vnx start` | Launch tmux session with orchestration components |
| `vnx cost-report` | Aggregate model usage and estimated cost from receipts |
| `vnx update` | Pull latest VNX from origin and re-install |
| `vnx bootstrap-skills` | Create/link AI CLI skills from shipped templates |
| `vnx bootstrap-terminals` | Create terminal CLAUDE.md files from templates |
| `vnx patch-agent-files` | Idempotent snippet patching for CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md |
| `vnx package-check` | Fail if runtime artifacts exist inside dist |

## Updating

After VNX is installed in a project, pull the latest version with:

```bash
.vnx/bin/vnx update
```

This clones the latest release, runs `install.sh`, and preserves your runtime data.

## CI

The repository includes `.github/workflows/vnx-smoke.yml`:

1. `vnx init`
2. `vnx doctor`
3. `vnx smoke`

Offline-only (no secrets, no API calls, no LLM). Targets sub-2-minute runtime.
